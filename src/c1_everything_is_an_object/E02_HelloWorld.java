/******************************* Exercise 2 ********************************
 * Following the HelloDate.java example in this chapter, create a “hello,
 * world” program that simply displays that statement. You need only a single method in your
 * class (the “main” one that gets executed when the program starts). Remember to make it
 * static and to include the argument list, even though you don’t use the argument list. Compile
 * the program with javac and run it using java. If you are using a different development
 * environment than the JDK, learn how to compile and run programs in that environment.
